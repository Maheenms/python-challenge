Python-Dual Challenge

In this homework, we have been assigned 2 challenges. These challenges will be a showcase of my new python skills that I have learned so far.  We will import modules like csv; export text files with results; read and write files in various formats; store contents in variables, lists, and dictionaries; loop through basic data structures; debug along the way; print the results to the terminal and also comment our code. 


Configuration: 

Before we start our assignment, we need to take a few steps to keep our files and folders organized and clean. Hence, we do the following:

1. On Github, create a new repository for the assignment called python-challenge and clone this our PC. 
2. Open the local Github repository on our PC, create folders for each python challenge named as PyBank and PyPoll.
3. Add the following to each folder of the challenge:
     *A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
     *A Resources folder that contains the CSV files we used. 
     *An analysis folder that contains the text file that has the results from our analysis.




Instructions For the Challenges:

PyBank:

In this challenge, we have financial records of our company. We will use the financial data called budget_data.csv to analyze the records and calculate the following:

   * The total number of months included in the dataset
   * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
   * The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes.
   * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
   * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
 
 The following is a screenshot of our analysis on the text file:

PyPoll:

In this challenge, we've been given a set of poll data called election_data.csv of a small, rural town inorder to modernize their vote counting process. We will use the data to analyze the votes and calculate the following :
     
 * The total number of votes cast.
 * A complete list of candidates who received votes.
 * Each candidate's precentage votes won.
 * The total number of votes each candidate won.
 * The winner of the election based on most votes.
